## 📊 How Market Cap Affects ROI

Market capitalization (market cap) represents the total value of a cryptocurrency. It's calculated by multiplying the current price by the circulating supply. When market cap increases (with constant supply), the price of each token increases. This calculator helps you understand how changes in market cap affect your investment.
